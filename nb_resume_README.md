### ABOUT

__I began my design career in elementary school.__ Ever since, I’ve continued to have a knack   
for combining words and images together, in eye-catching ways.    


__My visual storytelling experience makes me a better UX designer__ because I know the value    
of timing, the power of words and imagery, the importance of legible typography and hierarchy in   
a layout, what goes into developing a product from scratch—and, I'm comfortable managing   
many components of a project. 

__Feedback and collaboration from all involved is what I’m used to in design,__ since I’ve spent   
time working independently, as well as in-house—from the agency and corporate, to the sales   
and marketing sides.

__I use my keen eye for detail to create simple and intuitive data-driven designs that lead   
with empathy,__   and I'm seeking an opportunity that utilizes my strengths to collaborate with a   
multidisciplinary team. I can't wait to build upon my skills, and to continue creating impactful   
design experiences.
